# BombDetect.Objects
This is where you should implement your own objects.

Make sure to fork this repository and do it right:
- Categorize your objects if you've made a lot of them
- Don't stray *too* far away from low level code
- **DO NOT**, I repeat, ***DO NOT*** make a component. I swear if you do...

or just implement objects inside of your game's code
